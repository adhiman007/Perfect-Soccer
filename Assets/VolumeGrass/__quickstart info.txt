1. Create empty game object and add VolumeGrass script.
   a. Adding nodes - shift click, adding bezier handles - alt click
   b. Shift click on edge will insert node between
   c. Alt+shift click to define arbitral tesselation points on mesh
   d. Adjust settings and click "Build"
   
   Note: choose Hand Tool from Transform Tools palette to disable multiselection when adding nodes.
   
2. Add SetupForGrassRendering script to the camera and choose layers with objects that intersect the grass, keep in mind:
	
   a. make it simple (don't render whole scene into temporary depth buffer, but objects you need to properly intersect grass only)
   b. don't choose layers with grass (which would cause grass to be "self-occluded" and disappear during rendering)

3. If you intend to use LODs (up to 4 Level Of Detail meshes) for different distances, add VolumeGrassLODAdjuster script to your grass object.
